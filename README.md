# Webscraper-Wsoc

## About the App
I needed a way to quickly build spreadsheets to feed my daughter's college recruiting system for managing contact information and decision making in terms of which colleges align with her goals. The app scrapes Wikipedia and exports a CSV document of women's soccer programs in the US.  Built with Python and Pandas.

## Getting Started

1. Install Pandas.
```sh
> pip install pandas
```
2. Clone repo.
```sh
> git clone https://github.com/sonnyayran/webscraper-wsoc.git
```
3. Run script.
```sh
> scrape_wikip_wsoc_colleges.py
```
